# Custom Console Logger in JavaScript

Live access https://kiril6.github.io/customConsoleLogger/

This project provides a custom console logger for JavaScript that outputs log messages to a custom console container in the DOM, as well as the browser's console. It's a great tool for debugging and learning about JavaScript's console methods.

## Features

- Overrides the default console methods (`console.log`, `console.info`, `console.debug`, `console.warn`, `console.error`) to display their output in a custom console container.
- The console container is styled with CSS to look like a console window, and it can be toggled on and off with a button.
- Messages in the console container are color-coded based on the type of console method used.

## How to Use

1. Include the JavaScript and CSS files in your HTML file.
2. Call the console methods as you normally would in your JavaScript code.
3. Click the "Show Console" button to view the console messages in the custom console container.
